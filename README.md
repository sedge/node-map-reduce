## node-map-reduce

*NOTE: WIP*
*An extensible, barebones and fairly naive implementation of a map-reduce engine*

-------------------

### Features

1. Multi-threading support
2. Standardized module design, making adding new jobs easy
3. REST API for payload delivery
4. Sample jobs to help you dive in

### Dependancies

- Nodejs (v11)
- Redis (v5)

### Setup

1. Ensure node v11 is installed and accessible by the executing environment
2. Ensure redis is running
3. Run server with `npm start`
